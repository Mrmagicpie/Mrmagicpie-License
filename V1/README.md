Welcome to the Mrmagicpie-License V1. Please check out our details below!

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

Well, the Mrmagicpie-License is a closed source License flexible to the Licensor.

<h3>Why would I want to use this?</h3>

This is a License for someone that wants more control over their work. I do not recommend this for just anyone, sometimes I don't even trust myself to write an appropriate terms file. Please read through the examples, and make sure you know what you're doing before you start.

<h3>I have a problem with this!</h3>

<h4>For actual issues:</h4>

What counts as an actual issue? Below is a list of things considered as a real issue. If it's not on this list you may not get support!
- Spelling/Grammar in the License or Repository
- Someone is claiming this License as their own
- Suggestions on how to make this License more appropriate
- Legal concerns from using this License

Please create an Issue on our GitHub, [here](https://github.com/mrmagicpie/Mrmagicpie-License/issues).

<h4>For other issues:</h4>

Please read this whole README, and then come back.

Not real issues:
- Someone found a loophole in your Terms file
- You don't know how to use a License
- Anything you can't find from a quick Google search

I'm pretty laid back, but don't make issues for everything please.
