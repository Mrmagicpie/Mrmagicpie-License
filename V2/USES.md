<h2>General:</h2>

Generally, I'm laid back, but, there's one thing you must follow. If you want the Markdown version of the License, only use the Markdown version. For anything else, html conversion, yml, anything else, use the TXT version. The Markdown version is to only be used as Markdown!

This is very important. Remember it!
